# VSCode Snippets

My custom snippets I use within VS Code. I use this repo to sync it across platforms. I know there's a settings sync extension/plugin that exists for that, but it recently failed when I moved to another platform and erased everything!

### Installation

Clone this repo to the appropriate folder. You can find out where it is by `Ctrl + Shift + P` > `Configure User Snippets` and creating one to reveal the file location. On Windows, it should look something like

```
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets
```
